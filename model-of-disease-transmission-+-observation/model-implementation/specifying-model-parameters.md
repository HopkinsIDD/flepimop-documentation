# Specifying model parameters

TBA : This will include some info on specifying parameters that is general to different types of parameters. For example, how to specify parameters from a distribution instead of fixed value, or how to specify them being from an external timeseries.&#x20;

And, describe common parameter types that are created from dataseries, like

* Vaccination data
* Variant data
