Once `gempyor` is successfully installed locally \[add text about what that looks like], you will need to make sure the executable file `gempyor-seir.exe` is runnable via command line. To do this, you will need to add the directory where it was created to PATH. Follow the instructions [here](https://techpp.com/2021/08/26/set-path-variable-in-windows-guide/) to add the directory where this .exe file is located to PATH. This can be done via GUI or CLI.
